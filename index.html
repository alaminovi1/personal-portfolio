            <p>“You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching,

            <p>Masks help stop the COVID-19 virus from spreading, but that doesn't make them easy to introduce to
                children, as many parents have been discovering.The practice of wearing a mask to reduce the
                transmission of germs has a long history in some countries. But for many families, 2020 will be
                remembered as the first time putting on a mask. </p>
